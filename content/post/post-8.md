He wasn’t ready to give it up just yet. There hadn’t been, in his 30 years of existence, a definitive reason to quit altogether. If there had been, say, an accident, or medical expense, or loss of job he would have surely stopped for good, but there never were such occurrences to guide his trajectory anywhere but onward. That’s not to say his life hadn’t been without consequences for his behavior. There had been verbal disagreements, missed plans, every varietal of hangover, and the rapid heart palpitations that eventually made him quit with the straight bourbon on Sundays. Yet these always occurred far enough apart to excuse the behavior as the once-in-a-blue-moon type despite him never really taking a break, *ever*, from alcohol, since the age of 16.

His sophomore year in high school, after the cross country season had ended, his underclassmen buddies convinced him to get drunk with them at a friend’s house whose parents were out of town. He can’t remember anything of how it felt that first time other than the lurid brightness and numbing warmness of the friend’s kitchen where they seemed to spend most of the night huddled around the kitchen island, pouring vodka into novelty shot glasses shaped like skulls and baring the flags of Caribbean nations his buddy’s parents had traveled to in their 30-foot yacht. After that night he began sneaking milliliters of pours from his parent’s liquor cabinet with the precision of a neurosurgeon.

He never drank alone but he shared reluctantly. At his junior homecoming he took pills and got sick in front of his date. He rallied that night to finish off a bottle of Evian filled with Grey Goose. The next day was the worst hangover he ever experienced but his parents chalked it up to food poisoning from the Chinese restaurant where he had taken the pretty girl who dressed up just for him. He and the date never talked again.

He smoked marijuana and it only made him paranoid that everyone knew of his inebriation. His parents owned a seed shop and being the inquisitive mind he was, searched out possibilities for mind-altering substances among the aisles. This led him to ingesting 25 packets of morning-glory seeds with a fellow inquisitive mind. The result was noticeable but not consistently reproducible. He went to college.

Being the first in his family to attend higher-ed, he felt a great deal of pressure at maintaining high grades and sobriety on the weekdays. But the weekends were wild. He lived with an ROTC straight-edge, a cross country walk-on, and another first-in-family attendee who subverted his own parent’s pressure with daily bowls of hashish. These were the days when students were kicked off campus for toking up in the courtyard but hardly reprimanded for sexual assault. He chose drinking over smoking for that reason alone. He and his boys went out partying to meet girls and he found he could only do that while drunk.

He found it such an irony that the women he met at parties were equally inexperienced with substance and but yet treated the night as vacation, floating from one open bottle to the next, everyone their friend, and he wondered how it could ever feel so lonely to be so wanted.

His own problem with want was so cliché the mere thought of announcing it felt like parody. Was everyone struggling with their consumption the same as he? An adrift body in a sea of large vessels? Or were they all tossing their life rafts and coming aboard whatever ship had its coordinates set for destiny?

He withdrew his arms from the icy water and chose to float. Nature could never be so cruel as the currents of the present, he presumed. There he lay, tossing side-to-side aboard an envelope of cardboard, waiting for the sea to soak his refuge complete and draw him under the surface. Yet in the waiting he developed an intuition that life was much more than the pain he’d felt thus far. He felt something out there was bigger and larger than his appreciation for darkness and disgust at the status quo. His last three girlfriends didn’t know what *status quo* meant.

In his arm he etched the initials of all his former lovers with a dull ballpoint pen. The doctored limb spread blood from its openings like a clogged tub, slow at first and then pouring over without hesitation. He just wished that they could see his pain but it was too late. By the time the pain was visible he had dug too deep and the wound was irreversible. Even if he wanted it to stop and heal it was too late and those that had known him would know his pain as well. He lay, drooping, in the bottom of his parent’s porcelain basement tub, covered in a growing pool of his own blood, knowing that the help he needed would never come or come too late.

For the rest of her life his mother had to field questions related to the method of his demise. Had he done it slow, or quickly. What mess was left to clean? Whether rope or road, drugs or draught, how had, her only son, come to commit himself to death? The fact these details mattered to ‘friends’ was enough to render herself incapacitated. What kind of human asks their ‘friend’ about the method used to inflict the most harm on their only son? Did she ask the details of their divorces? The reasons their husbands could no longer maintain erections? Why they thought their daughters suddenly were more apt to say ‘fuck you’ than ‘sorry’? Why those who loved one another were more likely to fight than give forgiveness? Did she ever, in her 30 years of marriage, ask why her partner’s penis couldn’t give them a child of their own? Had she grown so tired of life that her son forgot what it meant to be alive? Was that also cliché? The mere privilege of breathing air? Take a deep breath. Feel the rich octane scald the nose’s inner nerves. She looks at her hands, cracked with age and the never-ending hustle of a life filled with love. She wishes for once that it was enough. It never was.
